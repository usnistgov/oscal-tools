# Profile resolver punchlist

This folder contains is an experimental profile resolver, to be developed and unit tested.

It works by generating an XSLT transformation from a profile, and then applying it to the imported catalogs.

The `../resolver-pipeline` folder (next to this folder) contains a profile resolver designed for purposes of demonstration, maintenance and testability. It should be tested and demonstrated first.

This implementation is designed for efficiency and performance.
