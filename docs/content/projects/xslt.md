[XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) is the Extensible Stylesheet Language, defined by the [World-Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) and now in version 3.0.

Applications offered here include:

- Rendering OSCAL catalogs in HTML and PDF
- "Refreshing" and generating "fresh" OSCAL documents (updating timestamps and/or UUIDs)
- Miscellaneous utilities

See the [directory in the repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools/tree/master/xslt) for current details.
