Applications offered here include:

- Rendering OSCAL catalogs in HTML and PDF
  - These include both "generic" and "NIST emulation" stylesheets
  - Tested in open source tools 
  - Suitable for adaptation and extension
- "Refreshing" and generating "fresh" OSCAL documents (updating timestamps and/or UUIDs)
- Miscellaneous utilities

See the [directory in the repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools/tree/master/xslt) for current details.
