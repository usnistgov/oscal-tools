[XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) is the Extensible Stylesheet Language, defined by the [World-Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) and now in version 3.0.

Applications offered from this repository include:

- Rendering OSCAL catalogs in HTML and PDF
  - These include both generic (any OSCAL) and "NIST emulation" (tuned to SP800-53-series) stylesheets
  - Tested in open source tools 
  - Suitable for adaptation and extension
- "Refreshing" and generating "fresh" OSCAL documents (updating timestamps and/or UUIDs)
- Miscellaneous utilities

See the [directory in the repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools/tree/master/xslt) for current details.

Users and organizations interested in helping to develop and refine this offering are invited to create [Issues in the repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools/issues) with ideas, needs, and feedback.
