Client-side [XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) is an architecture in which application logic is distributed to web clients (browsers) to apply to data under local control, without exposure. These applications depend on the SaxonJS implementation of XSLT within nodeJS or browser execution frameworks.

See the [CSX Demonstrations](/demos/csx) page for more specifics.

## Why client-side?

## Limitations

Currently these applications support only OSCAL XML, not OSCAL JSON (with the exception of the JSON-to-XML converter).
