This site is an open resource available for use and study by developers and organizations in the public and private sectors who wish to explore the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL).

All software presented or documented on this site, unless stated otherwise, is subject to the terms of the [NIST Disclaimer Statement](https://www.nist.gov/disclaimer), copied verbatim below (as of October 25 2021).

This site offers documentation and demonstration applications supporting and related to OSCAL --

  - As a springboard or launchpad for understanding
  - As an opportunity to test and demonstrate OSCAL technologies, specifications, and concepts
  - For use (where appropriate) <q>in the field</q> to address actual data processing requirements

Not all applications will be equally mature, and some may not even be fully usable or conformant (if and as specifications continue to evolve). If appearing here, an application should be said (unless stated otherwise) to come *without warranty, as these are R&amp;D applications not always tested fully*. That being said, real cupcakes can be baked in a toy oven, and each project here should document its own version(s) and dependencies.

## Site Organization

These site contents are arranged in two parallel branches, [Projects](/projects) and [Demos](/demos/). [Projects](/projects) pages will sometimes link to [Demos](/demos/) pages. [Demos](/demos/) pages should always link to [Projects](/projects) pages.  (This reflects how some but not all projects have demonstrations to be served.) Source code for both is maintained in the [Github repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools) - which also contains functioning code *not* documented on this site but described in `readme` documentation in the usual way. Specific projects and/or demos may be supported by manual, semi-automated or automated (CI/CD) build processes.

A link is also provided in the main menu to the [OSCAL web site](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL) where normative specifications can be found.

## Site and Project Maintenance Model

This site is presented as a point of access and source of information regarding tools and demonstrations stored in (and in some cases, served from) its repository, or elsewhere. Each project has its own development and maintenance plan appropriate to its deployment and objectives.

This information should be given on pages describing each project or in the readme files of the respective code bases themselves. Similarly, while users are urged to use the [Github Issues](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues) boards to report bugs and pose questions, it is likely that this feedback will be passed to the appropriate project owner or developer, with responses provided accordingly through those channels or others. Community channels such as public meetings, the Github repository Discussions support or resources such as the [OSCAL Gitter "Lobby"](https://gitter.im/usnistgov-OSCAL/Lobby) (real-time chat) are the best ways of determining the activity level and responsiveness for any given OSCAL-related initiative.

The developers of this site offer it as a parallel effort to the main [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL) development project, intended to complement and further catalyze those activities. As such we hope it will grow and evolve as long as OSCAL does.
