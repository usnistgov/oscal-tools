[OSCAL, the Open Security Controls Assessment Language](http://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL), is being developed as a public and non-proprietary technology by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) in partnership with government and industry. As such it is conceived of as an open resource available for use by developers and organizations in the public and private sectors.

This site offers documentation and demonstration applications supporting and related to OSCAL, as

  - A springboard or launchpad for understanding
  - An opportunity to test and demonstrate OSCAL technologies, specifications, and concepts
  - For use (where appropriate) <q>in the field</q> to address actual data processing requirements

Not all applications will be equally mature, and some may not even be fully usable or conformant (if and as specifications continue to evolve). If appearing here, an application should be said (unless stated otherwise) to come *without warranty, as these are R&amp;D applications not always tested fully*. That being said, real cupcakes can be baked in a toy oven, and each project here should document its own version(s) and dependencies.

This site is conceptually organized in two parallel branches, [Projects](/projects) and [Demos](/demos/). [Projects](/projects) pages will sometimes link to [Demos](/demos/) pages. [Demos](/demos/) pages should always link to [Projects](/projects) pages.  (This reflects how some but not all projects come with demonstrations.) Source code for both is maintained in the [Github repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools) - which also contains functioning code *not* documented on this site but described in `readme` documentation in the usual way.

Refer to the [OSCAL tools page](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/tools/) for more applications and software supporting OSCAL.
