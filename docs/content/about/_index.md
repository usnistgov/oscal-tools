[OSCAL, the Open Security Controls Assessment Language](http://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL), is being developed as a public and non-proprietary technology by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) in partnership with government and industry. As such it is conceived of as an open resource available for use by developers and organizations in the public and private sectors.

This site offers documentation and demonstration applications supporting and related to OSCAL, in order to provide a springboard or launchpad for understanding; to test OSCAL technologies, principles and concepts; and even for use (where appropriate) <q>in the field</q> to address actual data processing requirements.

Not all applications will be equally mature, and some may not even be fully usable or conformant (if and as specifications continue to evolve). If appearing here, by definition an application might be said to come *without warranty, as these are R&amp;D applications not always tested fully*. That being said, actual cupcakes can be baked in a toy oven.

This site is conceptually organized in two parallel branches, Projects and Demos. Projects pages will sometimes link to Demos pages. Demos pages should always link to project pages. Source code for both is maintained in the Github repository.

Refer to the [OSCAL tools page](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/tools/) for more applications and software supporting OSCAL.
