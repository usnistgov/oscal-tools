Client-side XSLT here relies on SaxonJS.

Original prototypes were developed for Balisage 2021.


Client-side [XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/) (CSX) is an architecture in which application logic written in XSLT (a declarative language) is distributed to web clients (browsers) to apply to data under local control, without exposure. These applications depend on the SaxonJS implementation of XSLT within nodeJS or browser execution frameworks.

Several of these applications were first offered at [Balisage: The Markup Conference 2021](https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol26/cover.html), and are reproduced here with grateful acknowledgement to conference organizers and attendees for helping to motivate their longer-term support and maintenance. Notwithstanding this support these applications should be regarded as *experimental* and suitable primarily for *demonstration* and *testing*.
