These rely on the public XSLTs released on the OSCAL web site, packaged and compiled to run in your browser.

As described in the Metaschema repository, OSCAL formats (in XML, JSON and YAML) can be defined as alternative serializations from a unified data model, described and constrained by an abstract, declarative set of definitions. Given sufficient formal rigor, this set of definitions can be used as a "backbone" for production of a number of different processing artifacts and productions, including not only documentation and faithful renderings in the form of operationally-ready schema languages (XSD or JSON Schema, for example) -- but also converter scripts.

In these pages, the converter scripts in XSLT generated from the OSCAL Catalog Metaschema are harnessed to provide for conversion of your OSCAL catalog dynamically, in the browser.
