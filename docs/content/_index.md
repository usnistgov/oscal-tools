NIST, in collaboration with industry, is developing the [Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)](http://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL). OSCAL is a set of formats expressed in XML, JSON, and YAML. These formats provide machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results.
