<h4>Important Note to Developers</h4>

<p>Every time the content of an OSCAL file changes, the following must also change:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new UUID value must be generated and assigned to the root element's <code>uuid</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>last-modified</code> field in metadata must be assigned with the date and time at the moment the file is saved with the modified content.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are two mechanisms by which tools can quickly "know" if a file has changed since it was last encountered. This document level UUID is the only UUID in OSCAL associated with version control.</p>

<p>When converting between formats, such as XML to JSON, these values should remain the same. This enables tools to know the content within the two formats is equivalent.</p></div>
