# OSCAL Tools

Tools supporting [OSCAL](http://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL), the Open Security Controls Assessment Language.

See project subdirectories for more information per project.

Also see the [OSCAL Tools site on NIST Pages](http://pages.nist.gov/oscal-tools), produced for this repository and hosting (or delivering) running demonstrations along with documentation.

There is also [Java tooling](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema-java) available for working with [Metaschema](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema), a [Java API for OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/liboscal-java), and an [OSCAL Java commandline tool](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-cli) available in other repositories. Early versions of these tools were once stored in this repository.
