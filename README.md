# OSCAL Tools

This repository supports a web site with [documentation and demonstrations](https://pages.nist.gov/oscal-tools).

[OSCAL](http://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL) is the Open Security Controls Assessment Language.

For a centralized listing of tools and software for use with OSCAL, regularly updated with listings from the community, see the [Tools page](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/tools/) on the main OSCAL site. If you wish to publicize an OSCAL tool, please use the contact offered on that page.

That page also helps make distinctions between commodity tools (supporting standard software components such as OSCAL schemas and data converters) and applications. Along with (documentation)[https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/reference/], standard software components normative for OSCAL are also maintained in the main repository:

- Schemas - [XML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/xml/schema) and [JSON](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/json/schema)  (also applicable to YAML)
- Converter utilities [into JSON from XML](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/json/convert) and [into XML from JSON](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/xml/convert).*

\* For data conversion, also see [OSCAL Java CLI](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-cli)

This site and repository is a *hub* for tools supporting OSCAL developed by the NIST team. It is not the only OSCAL Tools site, and it is not the only hub.

No comprehensive listing of OSCAL tools is available on this site, which has two functions:

1. Provides a repository for tools in development, which do not yet have their own repositories. (Over time such projects may migrate out of this repository.)
2. Provides an infrastructure for publishing documentation on tools, methods and methodologies, architectures and demonstrations.

See project subdirectories for more information per project.

Additionally, see also:

- [Java tooling](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema-java) available for working with [Metaschema](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema), a [Java API for OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/liboscal-java), and an [OSCAL Java command-line tool](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-cli) available in other repositories. Early versions of these tools were once stored in this repository.
- [OSCAL XSLT](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-xslt) and [XSLT3 Functions](https://github.com/usnistgov/xslt3-functions) for XSLT libraries, also once maintained on this site.
